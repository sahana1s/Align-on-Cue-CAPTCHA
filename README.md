# AI-Resistant CAPTCHA Systems
Traditional CAPTCHAs based on text, images, or audio are increasingly compromised, while biometric and adversarial methods raise concerns around privacy and usability. This project explores a new direction: cognitive and perceptual CAPTCHAs that leverage innate human advantages - such as flash-lag perception, biological motion, and gesture mimicry - to resist automation and relay attacks.
